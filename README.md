# Introduction 
MessageStream wraps the new Pipelines API into an easy to use framework for message serialization from generic data sources

# Getting Started
Very simple examples are located in MessageStream.Tests.Simple. That is the fastest and easiest way to get started.

# TODO
1. Serialization still needs work, it is not as built out as Deserialiazation.
1. The codegen pieces for deserialization do not work if you're interface implementations are declared explicitly.
1. Build out the README.
